# IDE

By default `Interface 0` responds to the **IDE interface**.

<br>
<br>

## Interface

If you wish to change this, you will have to use<br>
the soldering jumpers labeled `IDE address`.

<br>

The **IDE Interface** is chosen by the following <br>
connections made with the two jumpers.

| Jumper A | Jumper B | Interface |
|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| 游댮 | 游댮 | 0 |
| 游댮 | 游릭 | 1 |
| 游릭 | 游댮 | 2 |
| 游릭 | 游릭 | 3 |

<br>

## Disabling

If you however wish to **disable** the **IDE Interface**<br>
you will have to connect the `IDE Disable` jumper.
